    <h1>Hey Babe!</h1>  
    <p>
      I’ve been thinking a lot about what I should do for our 2nd monthsary💜. Every time, I want it to feel unique and special for you. 
      It honestly took me a while, but then it hit me… what if I revisit something I love and turn it into a gift for you...
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, it hasn’t been easy coding again after more than a year 😅. I’m not as good as you, but I poured every bit of effort and heart I have into crafting this from scratch. 
      This is my way of showing how much I love you, which, honestly, words could never fully explain❤️. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just wanted to take this chance as well to tell you how much I appreciate all the effort you put into us. We’ve had our ups and downs this month, but I’m so glad we stayed through it all🤍. 
      I’m proud of what you’ve become, what you’re about to become, and even of the things you’ve not become because you’re still you, and that’s who I love😘. 
      I’ll always be here cheering you on in whatever path you choose; as long as you’re happy, I’m happy😊. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m just so grateful we found each other. Thank you for listening to me, for never invalidating my rants or my impatience💗.  
      You probably noticed by now or not😅, but I incorporated some of your favorites, like the color purple and dark blue, plus one of your favorite flowers, tulips 🌷💜.
      Oh, and… I even wrote you a poem 😳. I’m not the best at it, but it was so much fun working on it this whole month along with the website. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you like it, babe. Just want to remind you… I love you more than you know. I love you James!!! Happy 2nd monthsary my love!💕

    <p>
      Across the miles, where silence may grow, <br>
      Your voice’s warmth still softly flows.   <br>
      Though distance tests and nights run long,<br>
      Our hearts beat steady, brave, and strong.</p>
    <p>
      Oh, those blue eyes that remind me of the ocean <br>
      Could be the sky too, so vast and divine. <br>
      I’d be lost, adrift in that endless hue,  <br>
      A willing captive, forever with you.      </p>
    <p>
      Your giggles and smiles, they melt my heart, <br>
      Each moment with you feels like a dream’s part. <br>
      Your nose, your lips I’ve yet to kiss,  <br>
      A longing I cradle in dawn’s soft mist. </p>
    <p>
      No words can measure how my love grew; <br>
      All I know is I’d love and cherish you.<br>
      With gentle head scratches to soothe and calm, <br>
      And whispers that vow you’re safe in my arms. </p>
    <p>
      May our love endure, may it thrive, <br>
      Through barren days and sparkless nights. <br>
      I’ll hold your hand, both fierce and near,<br>
      A promise to stay through doubt and fear. </p>
    <p>
      Je t’aime, Saranghae, Mahal kita, Te quiero, <br>
      None can capture the depth of my love for you. <br>
      So let my soul be the language you hear, <br>
      Forever yours, in every word, I swear. </p>
